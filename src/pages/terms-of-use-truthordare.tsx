        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg mb-3 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          All prices are subject to change without notice. Occasionally, we may
          offer promotional pricing as incentives or limited-time opportunities
          for qualifying purchases made during the promotional period. Due to
          the time-sensitive nature of these promotions, we cannot offer price
          protection or retroactive discounts or refunds for previous purchases
          in the event of a price reduction or promotional offering.

          Payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at the time of purchase
          confirmation. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is
          turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.

          package.

          purchase. No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed
          during the active subscription period.
